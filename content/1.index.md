# Sarno's Blog

Welcome to my Home Page!

You can click [here](/posts) to see my blog posts.

You can also see the [About page](/about) and an online version of [my CV](my-cv).

Interested in the code? View the source [here](https://github.com/MrSarno/PoetryInMotion), or [open an issue](https://github.com/MrSarno/PoetryInMotion/issues/new). I do care about this website a great deal, however it is intended to track my apprenticeship which has yet to start - and so I may be a bit slow initially to act on suggestions.
