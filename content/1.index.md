# Poetry In Motion

Welcome to my Home Page!

You can see the [About page](/about) and an online version of [my CV](my-cv).

This website previously had blog posts, but I've removed that section for now as I had not been actively writing new ones.

Interested in the code? View the source [here](https://github.com/MrSarno/PoetryInMotion), or [open an issue](https://github.com/MrSarno/PoetryInMotion/issues/new). I do care about this website a great deal, however it is intended to track my apprenticeship which has yet to start - and so I may be a bit slow initially to act on suggestions.
